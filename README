== Post-processing of NEXUS files

The post processing of NEXUS files requires three files:
 - the nexus file itself
 - a CSV file containing some trait information. One column in this file contains the sequence names as found in the input NEXUS file. The first line of the CSV file must contain the column names.
 - a file that gives a mapping from sequence names (as found in the input file) to the names that should be used in the generated NEXUS files. The first word (without spaces) in each line is interpreted as the input name and the rest as the output name.

In addition, a configuration file must be written, example:

~~~
traits_file: path_to_csv_file.csv
name_mappings_file: path_to_name_mapping_file.nds

# Name of the column containing the sequence names in the input NEXUS file
key: arb name
# Column containing the decimal latitude (optional)
lat: lat decimal
# Column containing the decimal longitude (optional)
lon: lon decimal
# If lat/lon is provided, the number of clusters that popart should use to classify the sequences geographically
ncluters: 5
# The trait columns
traits:
 - habitat
~~~

The tool is then called with this configuration file and the NEXUS file

~~~
nexus input.nex postprocess.config
~~~

it will create a directory called like the input file, but without the extension. In this directory will be created one file per trait, and one geotags file (if lat/lon has been provided), as e.g.:

~~~
input/geotags.nex
input/habitat.nex
~~~

If a trait is unknown for a sequence, set the corresponding cell to ? in the CSV file
